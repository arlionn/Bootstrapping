This repository contains all examples and additional code from the book. Feel free to clone, edit and comment the code.
The code presented here is neither the fastest nor the most elegant, but tries to highlight how the underlying algorithms work.
If you find bugs, please feel free to comment and improve the snippets here.

If you have never used Python, install it from here: https://www.python.org/

For editing and running code, I recommend Geany (https://geany.org/) as it is lightweight, easy to use and
runs on Linux, Windows and Mac. If you are interested in the statistical functions of Python, you probably
want to try something more advanced like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/), which provides
additional packages and programming environments for statistical analyses in Python.

Stata is a commercial statistical software package, but very popular and, in my opinion, the best for the
daily research routine (https://www.stata.com/). If you are looking for a short introduction to Stata, check
out my other book: [Stata - A Really Short Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Stata-Really-Introduction-Felix-Bittmann/dp/3110617293/ref=sr_1_17?crid=L4S9Y016WI7M&keywords=stata+introduction&qid=1555398519&s=gateway&sprefix=stata+intro%2Caps%2C205&sr=8-17)
